# Chessquito

## Promotion Cybersécurité du Logiciel 2020-2023

## How it works

`javac Chess.java` then `java Chess`.

It follows the rules of the Chessquito. *Too lazy to write them currently.*

Not all rules of basic chess are implemented, for example, a Rook can go over another piece. Have to fix it *one day.*
